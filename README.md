# GraphQL Sample

## Work in progress!

This is a small example project that uses the [Apollo GraphQL Android library](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android),
with Github's API.

The aim is to explore this library and GraphQL in general.

## Get a Github API Oauth token
ðŸ‘‰ https://developer.github.com/v4/guides/forming-calls/#authenticating-with-graphql

Then put it in `build.properties` (follow the sample in build.properties.SAMPLE).

## Architecture of the project

There is one activity which is simply a dumb host for 3 fragments:

### `ViewerInfoFragment`
Shows information about the "Viewer" (the currently logged-in user is called "Viewer" in the Github API):
- Login
- Name
- Email
- Total number of repos
- Info about the first 10 repos (name, description, number of stars)

Interesting to see: all this information is fetched with a single query (see `ViewerInfoQuery.graphql`).

### `RepositoryListFragment`
Displays a paginated list of the viewer's repositories.

Interesting to see:
- use of a GraphQL "fragment" (see `UserRepositoryListQuery.graphql`)
- how pagination works in GraphQL ("cursor")
- use of the Android Pagination component

### `MiscFragment`
Demonstrates mutations and error handling (see `AddCommentToIssueMutation.graphql`)
- Add comment to an issue that exists
- Add comment to an issue that doesn't exist (error case)
- Use the "search" operation and demonstrate a case with heterogeneous results (either `User` or `Organization`, see `SearchQuery.graphql`)
